Diabetic Retinopathy Project Using Deep Learning

Diabetic retinopathy is a condition suffered by people who have diabeties, which leads to permanent blindness if not treated in time.
The project aims at developing a machine learning model for the early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning techniques.

Goal:
Develop a model to identify Diabetic Retinopathy in its early stages. Early detection is crucial for preventing vision loss associated with DR.

Methods:

Deep Learning: The project leverages deep learning, a subfield of machine learning known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture particularly well-suited for analyzing image data. They can automatically learn features from the images that are relevant for DR detection.
Transfer Learning: The project employs transfer learning, a technique where a pre-trained CNN model is used as a starting point. This pre-trained model has already learned some general image recognition capabilities, which can be fine-tuned for the specific task of DR detection.
Libraries: TensorFlow and Keras are popular open-source libraries used for building and training deep learning models.
Data:

Dataset: The project utilized a diverse dataset of 20,000 retinal images. Diversity in the dataset is important to ensure the model generalizes well and performs accurately on unseen data.
Preprocessing: The retinal images were likely preprocessed using techniques from the OpenCV library. Preprocessing might involve resizing images, adjusting color balance, or normalizing pixel intensities. This helps prepare the images for the CNN model.
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning and CNNs for early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. By leveraging transfer learning and a diverse dataset, the project aimed to develop a model that can be a valuable tool for ophthalmologists in identifying DR and preventing vision loss in diabetic patients.
